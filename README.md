# Quantum Knapsack

## Description

Quantum Knapsack presents a twist to the famous knapsack optimization problem by introducing **quantum concepts** in a gamified manner. Given a knapsack (with known capacity) and an array of qubits (of varying weights and values), the player's goal is to select the optimal set of qubits that will maximize their value without exceeding the knapsack's capacity. Select quantum mechanics (superposition, entanglement, decoherence) will be introduced through the behavior of these qubits.
